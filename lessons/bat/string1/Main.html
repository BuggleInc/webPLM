<h1>String fun</h1>

<p>Strings are the simplest of the complex data types :) They provide
   several operations, such as getting the length of the string, or a
   substring of it.</p>
   
<p>A very good introduction to this type is available here: http://codingbat.com/doc/java-string-introduction.html</p>
