<h1>Bubble Baseball</h1>

<p>Crap, we adapted the insertion sort because our selection sort required too
much moves to get the selected players to their position, but the insertion
sort requires an inordinate amount of changes to get the border elements to
their position within the sorted area without mixing the already sorted
elements. At the end of the day, our selection variant was more efficient
with at most <code>3*amountOfBase</code> moves to sort one element (1 to get
the hole alongside with the player, and 2 to get the hole+player in
position) while our insertion variant requires at most
<code>3*amountOfPlayers</code> to sort one element (2 to descend the hole
and player in position, 1 to get the hole back to its position). That's
twice as bad as there is two players per base. It may be possible to improve
the insertion sort by moving by more than one element when descending, but
it seems uneasy (at least, while not mixing the already sorted elements) and
it would probably only ensure that our insertion variant becomes as
efficient as our selection variant, not dramatically better.</p>

<p>Se não pudermos tornar o ordenamento mais rápido, podemos torná-lo
mais fácil. Se pensar a respeito, parece natural adaptar a ordenção
bolha para este problema: o buraco se torna a bolha que se move para
cima e para baixo, ordenando um pouco o array a cada passagem. As
linhas grandes são simples: "enquanto (while) não estiver ordenado,
mova o buraco para baixo até a base 0 (movendo o maior jogador de cada
base em cada passo) e então de volta à base maximal (movendo o menor
jogador de cada base)". depois de um tempo,
<code>estáOrdenado()</code> vai retornar verdadeiro e seu algoritmo
vai parar.</p>

<p>This is so easy that we introduce another variant of the problem, with more
than two players per base.  But actually, that shouldn't block you very
long, should it?</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the bubble sort variant requires ways less moves than the
other variants. This is astonishing because usually, the bubble sort
performs much worse than the others sorts, but it comes from the very good
match between its big lines and the baseball universe. It actually happens
rather often that a pleasantly written algorithm performs very decently. But
this is not an universal rule either, as demonstrated by the naive algorithm
of the first exercise, that was nice, simple and wrong ;)</p>
