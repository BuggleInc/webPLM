<h1>The Dutch Flag Problem</h1>

<p>This problem was first proposed by E.W Dijkstra in 1976 (in the chapter 14 of his book "A Discipline of Programming").
It is a very classical variation of the sorting algorithms since then. It is sometimes useful in real life, but 
it became famous for its pedagogical properties: its complexity is not trivial, but not complex either. 
It can easily be formally proven, but it's not absolutely trivial either. </p>  

<h3>What can I do to improve this PLM universe?</h3>

<p>As usual, there are several things that could be done in the code of this universe to improve it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A temporal view could be welcomed.</li>
  <li>Other exercises, for example with 2 colors only or with more than 3 colors, could generalize the proposed approach.</li>
  <li>This problem could be solved recursively.</li>
</ul>
