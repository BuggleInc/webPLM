<h1>Recursive algorithms</h1>
This lesson allows to experiment with recursive algorithms. 

<p>If you need more recursive algorithms, an exercise on recursive sorting
algorithms (in particular QuickSort and MergeSort) is planned in the future
within the sorting lesson.</p>

<h3>What can I do to improve this lesson?</h3>

<p>As usual, there are several things that could be done in this lesson to improve it further:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Sierpinski triangle can be drawn using a simpler L-system. See http://jpvallon.free.fr/recursivite.html</li>
  <li>The arrowhead curve is also interesting: http://www.mathcurve.com/fractals/sierpinski/sierpinskitriangle.shtml</li>
  <li>The dragon curve could be explained as a L-system: http://ecademy.agnesscott.edu/~lriddle/ifs/heighway/heighway.htm</li>
  <li>The dragon2 curve is called the twin dragon: http://ecademy.agnesscott.edu/~lriddle/ifs/heighway/twindragon.htm</li>
  <li>The space filling curves could be added (Peano, Hildebert, etc).
      See: http://teachout1.net/village/fill.html </li>
  <li>We could do another exercise on embeeded polygons:

</ul>
