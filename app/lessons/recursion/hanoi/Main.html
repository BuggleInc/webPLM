<h1>Hanoi towers</h1>
<p>Here comes the super classical exercise on recursion along with
some variations. If you have any other nice variations, please submit them. 
At some point, someone should also probably contribute these variations to
wikipedia, as only the base problem is nicely described there.</p>

<p>The Interleaved and Split variations come from the following
article: "Exploring Recursion with Variations on the Towers of Hanoi", 
Daniel W. Palmer. Available at
http://www.ccscjournal.willmitchell.info/Vol12-96/No2a/Daniel%20W%20Palmer.pdf</p>

<p>The Linear Hanoi is briefly discussed in the article presenting the Linear Twin
Towers of Hanoi: "The Linear Twin Towers of Hanoi Problem", Steven Minsker (ACM SIGCSE 
Bulletin Volume 39 Issue 4, December 2007). This article can only be accessed through 
the paywall of the editor, sorry.</p>

<p>The 3-colors Towers of Hanoi problem was presented on this web page: 
http://www.cut-the-knot.org/recurrence/TricolorHanoiAuto.shtml</p>

<p>The Cyclic Towers of Hanoi was proposed by M.D. Atkinson in an article of 1981 
titled "The cyclic towers of Hanoi" (Information Processing Letters, Volume 13:3).
