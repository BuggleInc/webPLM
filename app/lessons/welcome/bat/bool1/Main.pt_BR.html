<h1>Boolean fun</h1>

<p>Boolean operations are one of the very basic task in programming.  As long
as you cannot write a not so simple boolean test under the minute, you
probably will have a very bad time writing a real program.</p>
   
<p>That is why this lesson provides you a bunch of such exercises, so that you
can get trained in this.</p>
