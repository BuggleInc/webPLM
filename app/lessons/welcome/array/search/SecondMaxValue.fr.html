<h1>Second Biggest Value</h1>

<p>In this exercise, you must compute the second maximal value contained in an
array, i.e. the value that becomes the maximum if you remove the current
maximum from the array.</p>.
 
<p>As usual, you should gather the information in only one traversal of the
array.</p>
