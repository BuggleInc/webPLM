<h2>Welcome in the Buggles' World</h2>

<p>You just started the Programmer's Learning Machine. This is a Learning Management
System  aiming at teaching the art of computer programming through interactive
exercises. It is constituted by a set of exercises grouped by lessons, allowing you 
to practice at your own pace. Currently, the environment is configured to be programmed 
in the [!thelang/] programming language, but you can change it from the Language menu 
if you want, or by clicking on the [!thelang/] icon at the right of the status bar below.</p>

<p>In this first lesson, the buggles will lead your first steps in programming.</p>

  <h3>The <i>buggles</i>? What is this??</h3>

  <p>The buggles are little animals obeying any order you may give them. In each
  exercise, you have to provide them with the right instructions so that the
  world turns into the objective of the exercise. For example in this exercise, 
  you should instruct your buggle to move forward once. You can see that by checking
  the difference between the <i>World</i> view and the <i>Objective</i> one. 
  Depending on the exercise (and your settings in the Language menu), your code must 
  be written in either C, Java, Python or Scala.</p>
  
  <h3>Working environment</h3>

  <p>Before going any further, get familiar with the working environment. Have a 
  look at the several elements composing the main window, move your mouse over 
  them to show the tooltip, and experiment with the elements to see what they do.
  The white area below is the console: this is where errors and messages get 
  displayed.</p>
  
  <p>If your code contains errors (and code always do at some point), the 
   computer will display error messages in the console. You obviously have to 
   fix the errors to pass the exercises. The messages that get displayed may 
   sound scary at first glance, but don't panic. The compiler is only somehow 
   limited in its communication abilities, but he's not mean. If you look closer, 
   the solution to solve your issue is written in the middle of those cryptic
   messages. You will see, with a bit of habit, we get used to it.</p>
  
  <h3>What am I supposed to do?</h3>
  
  <p>It's time to write your first program. Simply ask your buggle to move one step 
  forward using the Source Code pane. For that, simply write the following code
  (clicking on the interactive controls is not enough: You have to write the code 
  after experimenting interactively).</p>
   <pre>[!java|scala|python]forward()[!java];[/!][/!][!c]stepForward();[/!]</pre>
  [!java|c]<p>Do not forget the final <code>;</code> which tells the compiler that the
  instruction is over (yes, computers are so dumb that they cannot <i>guess</i> 
  obvious stuff like this).</p>[/!]
  
  <p>Once done, click on run. You can proceed to next exercise once it works.</p>
