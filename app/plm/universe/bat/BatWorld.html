<h1>BatWorld</h1>

<p>This world is a simplistic testing environment largely inspired from
the http://codingbat.com invented by Nick Parlente.</p>

<p>The typical exercises are very short ones, aiming at improving the
   tactical programming abilities of the students. That is to say that
   you will be presented a quite long list of very little exercises
   about rather simple things. The idea is to train you on these
   issues until they become automatic to you.</p>
   
<p>In contrary to the other worlds, the BatWorld does not provide any
   fancy abstraction nor visualization. You have to fill a function,
   which gets called for a bunch of parameter sets, and that's it.</p>
   
<p>For more information, you should refer to the CodingBat.com documentation, 
   which contains for example a very useful documentation on boolean operators:
   http://codingbat.com/doc/ifboolean.html</p>
