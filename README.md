WebPLM
==============

This is the web interface of the
[PLM](https://github.com/BuggleInc/PLM) project. It uses the [Play
Framework](https://www.playframework.com/) as the back-end and
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) for the front-end.

Getting Started
---------------

First, [install Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/Installing).

Once you cloned this repository, you can run the application in
production mode by running ```activator start ``` from the root
directory.

If you prefer to run it in debug mode (where it reloads everything
automatically when files change), use ```activator ~run``` instead.
Remove the ~ so that it only reloads when you reload the page in the
browser.

To access to your application, browse to <http://localhost:9000> If
you want to start it on port 8080 instead, use ```activator "~run
8080"```
