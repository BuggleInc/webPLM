WebPLM
==============

This project's goal is to move [PLM](https://github.com/oster/PLM) from a fat client to a web application using [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/) as the back-end and [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) to provide the front-end.

Getting Started
---------------

First, [install Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/Installing).

Now you have to clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/MatthieuNICOLAS/webPLM.git
```

You may now run the application using the following commands:
```
cd path/to/webPLM
activator start
```

To access to your application, browse to <http://localhost:9000>
