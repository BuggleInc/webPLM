This directory contains all the translator files related to the
translation of missions. The translation files related to the engine
are located in the ../l10n-engine directory, updated from the main ant
build.xml file.

Files used to translate the missions:
- plm.pot: master file of missions text
- XX.po: translations of missions into language XX
Simply run "po4a po4a.conf" from the root directory to update the
translated html files (check the wiki for more info).

Note that due to an issue in the application server, we cannot use
pt_BR as a language. We must pretend that this is pt. Sorry guys.
